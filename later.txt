I'm supported by a <a href='https://www.pdsoros.org/meet-the-fellows/meena-jagadeesan'>PD Soros Fellowship for New Americans</a> and a <a href='https://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/fellowships-entering/'> Berkeley Fellowship</a>. Before coming to Berkeley, I graduated from Harvard, where I studied computer science, mathematics, and statistics. In Summer 2020, I interned at <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-ai/'>Microsoft Research AI</a>.<br><br> -->
